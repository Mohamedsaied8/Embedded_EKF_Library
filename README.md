# Arduino_EKF_Library
This is a compact Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) library for Teensy4.0/Arduino system (or real time embedded system in general).
- It's not using Eigen (small source code - more simple to understand).
- It's not using C++ Standard Library/std (for embedded consideration).
- If you set `SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION` to `SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION_EMBEDDED_NO_PRINT` in `konfig.h`, the code is platform agnostic (not using any library beside these C header files: `stdlib.h`, `stdint.h`, and `math.h`).
- There's no malloc/new/free dynamic memory allocation for real time application (but using heavy stack local variables, so you need to run it through static memory analyzer if you are really concerned about implement this in mission critical hard real time application).
